There is a theory in Linguistics called *Linguistic Relativity* that
hypothesizes that the language we speak affects our worldview and
cognition. Alan Perlis suggests that this is likely to be true of
programming languages as well, where the language in which we write
code affects how we think about programming. In this course, you will
learn a paradigm of programming called Functional Programming, which,
if you were not exposed to previously, will fundamentally alter the
way you think about programming. Functional programming has
contributed several powerful abstractions and techniques, such as
Garbage Collection, Type Systems, Lambdas, and MapReduce, that have
together shaped the modern approach to programming. Indeed, functional
languages are breeding grounds of new ideas that eventually make their
way into mainstream programming. Why not be ahead of the curve and be
a pioneer yourself? This course teaches you functional programming
through the lens of [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/), and introduces you to
novel programming abstractions and techniques that change the way you
approach problem-solving, and help you write efficient, maintainable,
and correct code.

## Textbook

* There is no published textbook for this course. We will rely on
  class notes distributed via Jupyter notebooks and PDFs. 
* The main reference material for OCaml is [Real World
  OCaml](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/), 2nd
  Edition, by Yaron Minsky and Anil Madhavapeddy. 
* The secondary reference material for OCaml is Cornell cs3110's
  textbook: [OCaml Programming:
  Correct+Efficient+Beautiful](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html) 
* Pierce's [Types and Programming Languages](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) is a recommended reading. This book is available for checkout at [CU Libraries](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/ucb/detail.action?docID=3338823).
