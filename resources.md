We make extensive use of Coq theorem prover in this class.

# Installing Coq

* You can play around with Coq in a browser using
  [jsCoq](https://coq.vercel.app/), although this is not recommended for
  serious development.

* [Coq platform binaries](https://coq.inria.fr/download) are available for
  Mac and Windows. Coq platform includes a stand-alone IDE for Coq
  development called Coqide. 

* Alternatively, you can use [Visual Studio
  Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an IDE for Coq development with
  help of a vscode plugin called vscoq. See
  [here](https://github.com/coq-community/vscoq#instructions) for
  instructions.
